# NETFLIX-clone
A Netflix clone using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. It features JWT authentication and a responsive UI. Users can fetch movies and TV shows, search for actors, watch trailers, track their search history, and discover similar content—all on an awesome landing page that I’ve deployed for everyone to enjoy!
